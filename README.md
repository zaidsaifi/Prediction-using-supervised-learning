# Predicting Student Scores

This project focuses on predicting students' percentage scores based on the number of study hours using a simple linear regression model.

## Overview

In this data science project, we aim to explore the relationship between students' study hours and their percentage scores. The hypothesis is that students who study more hours tend to achieve higher scores. To validate this hypothesis, we employ a simple linear regression model, assuming a linear connection between study hours and scores.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
3. Install the necessary dependencies.

## Results

The trained linear regression model aims to predict students' percentage scores based on the number of study hours. The project helps us understand the impact of study hours on academic performance and provides a practical example of applying a simple machine learning technique.
